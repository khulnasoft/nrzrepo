To get the best experience with `nrz`, Nrzrepo provides a few utilities for integrating with your editor.

## JSON Schema for `nrz.json`

Nrzrepo uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to give you auto-complete in your
`nrz.json` file. By including the `$schema` key in your `nrz.json`, your editor is able to
provide full documentation and linting in case you have invalid shapes or missing keys.

### Sourcing from the web

A `schema.json` is accessible at the URL shown below. This has the advantage of not needing to run your package manager's install command to see in-editor validation.

```json title="./nrz.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json"
}
```

There is also a major versioned `schema.json` available, following the format of `https://turbo.build/schema.<version>.json`.

```json title="./nrz.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.v1.json"
}
```

### Sourcing from `node_modules`

Starting in Nrzrepo 2.4, `schema.json` is available in `node_modules` once you've run your package manager's install command:

```json title="nrz.json"
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/nrz/schema.json"
}
```

<Callout title="node_modules location">
  We recommend installing `nrz` at the root of your repository, so the path
  for the schema should point to `node_modules` at the root of your repository.
  In [Package Configurations](/repo/docs/reference/package-configurations), you
  may need to use a path like `../../node_modules/nrz/schema.json`.

## Linting for environment variables

Handling environment variables is an important part of building applications in a Nrzrepo.

[The `eslint-config-nrz` package](/repo/docs/reference/eslint-config-nrz) extends your ESLint setup to help you make sure you've taken care of all of your environment variables.

## Nrzrepo LSP

Enable even more auto-complete and linting than provided by JSON Schema, with in-editor hinting for invalid globs, references to non-existent tasks or packages, and
extra repository visibility tools.
