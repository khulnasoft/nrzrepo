import { Callout } from '#/components/callout';
import { PackageManagerTabs, Tabs, Tab } from '#/components/tabs';

Get started with Nrzrepo in a few moments using:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-nrz@latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
```bash title="Terminal"
yarn dlx create-nrz@latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm dlx create-nrz@latest
```

</Tab>

</PackageManagerTabs>

The starter repository will have:

- Two deployable applications
- Three shared libraries for use in the rest of the monorepo

For more details on the starter, [visit the README for the basic starter on GitHub](https://github.com/khulnasoft/nrzrepo/tree/main/examples/basic). You can also [use an example](/repo/docs/getting-started/examples) that more closely fits your tooling interests.

## Installing `nrz`

`nrz` can be installed both globally **and** in your repository. We highly recommend installing both ways so you can take advantage of fast, convenient workflows _and_ a stable version of `nrz` for all developers working in your repository.

### Global installation

A global install of `nrz` brings flexibility and speed to your local workflows.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash title="Terminal"
  npm install nrz --global
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash title="Terminal"
  yarn global add nrz
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash title="Terminal"
  pnpm install nrz --global
  ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Once installed globally, you can run your scripts through `nrz` from your terminal, quickly running one-off commands to use within your repository. For example:

- `nrz build`: Run `build` scripts following your repository's dependency graph
- `nrz build --filter=docs --dry`: Quickly print an outline of the `build` task for your `docs` package (without running it)
- `nrz generate`: Run [Generators](/repo/docs/guides/generating-code) to add new code to your repository
- `cd apps/docs && nrz build`: Run the `build` script in the `docs` package and its dependencies. For more, visit the [Automatic Package Scoping section](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#automatic-package-scoping).

<Callout type="good-to-know">
  `nrz` is an alias for [`nrz run`](/repo/docs/reference/run). For example,
  `nrz build` and `nrz run build` will both run your `build` task.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Avoid multiple global installations">
  If you've installed global `nrz` before, make sure you use the same package
  manager as your existing installation to avoid unexpected behaviors. You can
  quickly check which package manager you previously used with [`nrz
  bin`](/repo/docs/reference/bin).
</Callout>

#### Using global `nrz` in CI

You can also take advantage of global `nrz` when creating your CI pipelines. Visit the [Constructing CI](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/constructing-ci#global-nrz-in-ci) guide for more information.

### Repository installation

When collaborating with other developers in a repository, it's a good idea to pin versions of dependencies. You can do this with `nrz` by adding it as a `devDependency` in the root of your repository:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash title="Terminal"
  npm install nrz --save-dev
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash title="Terminal"
    yarn add nrz --dev --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash title="Terminal"
    pnpm add nrz --save-dev --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can continue to use your global installation of `nrz` to run commands. Global `nrz` will defer to the local version of your repository if it exists.

This lets you to get the best of both installations: easily run commands in your terminal while maintaining a pinned version for consistent usage for all developers in the repository.
