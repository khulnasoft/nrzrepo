## Package managers

Core `nrz` functionality depends on the package managers in the JavaScript ecosystem and their implementations of Workspaces and
lockfiles formats.

| Package manager | Supported                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| pnpm 8+         | Yes                             |
| npm 8+          | Yes                             |
| yarn 1+         | Yes (Includes Yarn Plug'n'Play) |
| bun 1+          | Beta                            |

<Callout type="info">
  Package managers have their own release schedules, bugs, and features. While
  we intend to keep up with new major versions, we likely will not be able to
  release support immediately.
</Callout>

## Platforms

`nrz` is generally supported on Debian-based Linux distributions, macOS, and
Windows on both x86_64 and ARM 64 architectures. Specifically, we build and ship
the following binaries via npm:

- `nrz-darwin-64` (macOS with Intel chips)
- `nrz-darwin-arm64` (macOS with Apple Silicon)
- `nrz-linux-64`
- `nrz-linux-arm64`
- `nrz-windows-64`\*
- `nrz-windows-arm64`\*

  \*: Requires [Windows C Runtime
  Libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)

## Node.js

Core `nrz` functionality does not depend on the
active Node.js version on your system, but [some packages in the Nrzrepo ecosystem](/repo/docs/reference#packages)
such as [`create-nrz`](/repo/docs/reference/create-nrz), [`nrz-ignore`](/repo/docs/reference/nrz-ignore), and [`eslint-config-nrz`](/repo/docs/reference/eslint-config-nrz) do. For these features,
we intend to support the [Active and Maintenance LTS versions of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).

Nrzrepo's [examples](/repo/docs/getting-started/examples) are also expected to work with these Node.js versions.

## Version control

We support repositories that are version controlled with Git and repositories that don't have
version control at all. Any other version control system will be ignored.

Note that we use Git to hash files, so repositories without git may perform and behave differently.

## LTS policy

Major versions of Nrzrepo will be supported for two years from the release date of the next major version.

Changes required for critical security fixes in older versions will be backported. Such situations will be rare and will land as semver-minor releases, even if they are breaking changes.

We highly encourage you to use the most current version of Nrzrepo whenever possible.

| Major version | Release date | End-of-life date |

| 1.x           | Dec. 9, 2021 | Jun. 4, 2026     |
