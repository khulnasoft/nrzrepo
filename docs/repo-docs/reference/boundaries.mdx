Boundaries ensure that Nrzrepo features work correctly by checking for package manager Workspace violations.

```bash title="Terminal"
nrz boundaries
```

This command will notify for two types of violations:

- Importing a file outside of the package's directory
- Importing a package that is not specified as a dependency in the package's `package.json`

<Callout title="Boundaries RFC">
  This feature is experimental, and we're looking for your feedback on [the
  Boundaries RFC](https://github.com/khulnasoft/nrzrepo/discussions/9435).
  Additionally, please provide your use cases for user-defined Boundaries to
  help inform the next iteration of our design.
</Callout>
